# Insurance Claim Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of insurance claims data to uncover patterns and insights related to demographics and health factors influencing insurance claims. By examining variables such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure levels, diabetic status, number of children, smoking status, and region, we can gain valuable insights into who is most likely to file an insurance claim. This analysis can inform decision-making for insurance companies and policymakers, offering targeted support to vulnerable groups.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Detailed exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution and relationship of variables.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigation of the correlation between various factors to identify significant influences on insurance claims.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Analysis of insurance claims across different demographic groups to identify patterns.
- **Health Factor Analysis**: Examination of how health-related factors impact the likelihood of filing an insurance claim.
- **Regional Insights**: Analysis of regional differences in insurance claims to uncover geographical patterns.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web application to showcase the analysis.
